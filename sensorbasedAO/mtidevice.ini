**Following params can be used at start of user application by using the

**LoadDeviceParams('mtidevice.ini') command.  Already built applications provided

**by MirrorcleTech also load parameters from this file.

**********************************************************************************



**User should modify following params according to each MEMS device datasheet:



VdifferenceMax = 159

HardwareFilterBw = 500

Vbias = 80



**Additional params based on user's application of the Controller:



DataMode = Sample_Output

SyncMode = Output_DOut0

DeviceAxes = Normal

DigitalOutputEnable = 1

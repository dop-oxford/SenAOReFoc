# centroiding.py: 
	- check how the size of the S-H spots affect the effectiveness of the dynamic range and thresholding

# calibration.py:
	- check what parameters are needed for centroiding and finish centroiding function here, and whether it is better to perform centroiding at the end or 	     while grabbing images
	- check whether image needs to be continuosly displayed for each voltage
	- write algorithm for acquiring influence function using Zernikes
